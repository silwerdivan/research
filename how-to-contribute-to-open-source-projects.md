# How to contribute to open source projects

[Contributing to Open Source Can Change Your Life - Hereâ€™s How to Do It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CML6vfKjQss)

### Find projects to contribute to

Don't browse through the millions of projects, instead use the Explore menu item. Here you can browse by topic or go to topics like "good first issue" or "contributions welcome". Or even better, contribute to a project you are using in one of your projects. Look through your dependencies and find something that's open source. Then go through the issues to find something you're comfortable with. Go through the README to see the rules for contributing.

### Fork the project

Now you have your very own copy. Clone the project and make a branch. Now it's time to make changes. There's all kinds of things you can do. Fix typos, update documentation, or even introduce a feature. Be thoughtful and considerate with your changes. Add, commit and push up to your fork. Now it's time to create a new pull request on your branch. This will open a pull request on the parent project with the changes on your branch. If your pull request addresses an issue, mention the issue number in the pull request notes, so GitHub can automatically annotate and potentially close the issue.

### Wait for feedback

You've completed the easy part, now you wait for feedback and reviews.
